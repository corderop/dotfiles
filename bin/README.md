# ðŸª„ Scripts

These folder aims to store all the simple script that I use everyday. Most of them are developed by me, others are adapted from existing ones.

* `tgit`: Clone a git repository in a temp folder.
* `2phonetics`: Convert a word to its phonetics and copy them to the clipboard.
* `ocrscreen`: Let OCR the part of the screen selected with the mouse.
